# EAT DA BURGER

### USER STORY
```
As a developer, I want to create an app that utilizes MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and homemade ORM, all while employing structural and filepath conventions. 
```
### DESCRIPTION/UX
```This file directory contains code that, with the aforementioned technologies, will allow app users to render, add-to, and update data from a preexisting database, in this case one containg a table or burgers, their respective names, and a boolean value associated with whether or not they've been 'devoured'. Front-end javascript has been incorporated to link the app's button functionality to the evoloving MySQL database.```

```
Below is a screenshot of the app, along with several links, including one to the corresponding GitHub repository, one to the deployed Heroku app, and a final link connecting readers to an upodated Portfolio page (updated to include this project).
